# Beach

## What is it?
One of the most commom places you go when you have fun is to... beach! 
And here, I have some codes I developed while I was working/having fun. I like 
to write codes, mostly in PHP, and here I'll have my tests. 

## What am I doing now?
By now, I'm working on RNA's folder, related to Artificial Neural Network. For more
information, take a look at the README of RNA folder.
