# Beach

## What is it?
One of the most commom places you go when you have fun is to... beach! 
And here, I have some codes I developed while I was working/having fun. I like 
to code, mostly in PHP, and here I'll have my tests. 

## What have I developed so far?
### For Classification:
- Perceptron;
- kNN;
- (Determinist and Stochastic) Least Squares;
- Extreme Learning Machine.

### For Optimization:
- Artificial Bee Colony;
- Differential Evolution;
- Genetic Algorithms:
    - Regular optimization;
    - Traveler Salesman Problem solved.
- Particle Swarm Optimization;    

### Utils:
- Class for CSV handling;
- Activation Functions and Objective Functions;
- Classes for logging;
- Classes for Holdout and Cross validation;
- Class for simple mathematical operations.

## What am I doing now?
_(this section may not be updated)_

By now, I'm working on Genetic Algorithms. For more
information, take a look at the README of Genetic folder.
