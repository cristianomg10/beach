This is a collection of files related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). RNA is the translation of ANN to my language (Portuguese).

It is under development, and requires PHP7 and markrogoyski/math-php .

There are examples on how to train a Perceptron and how to use the classes ```Perceptron``` and ```PerceptronLearning``` in the folder ```ANN/Examples```.
