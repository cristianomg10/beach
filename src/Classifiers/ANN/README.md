# ANN

## What is it?

This is a collection of files related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
I might change this folder's name in a near future.

## Requirements

It is under development, and requires PHP7 and markrogoyski/math-php .

## Examples

There are examples on how to train a Perceptron, an ELM and how to use the classes ```Perceptron```, ```PerceptronLearning``` and ```ExtremeLearningMachine```  in the folder ```ANN/Examples```.

## Readme
- Unfortunately, My ELM implementation is not working properly, in a reasonable time for middle-sized databases, for example 6800x14. The matrices operations are taking too long to be completed. If you have any suggestion or idea on how to fasten it, please mail me.
- Thanks to Diego Catalano (https://github.com/DiegoCatalano/), for helping me with the implementation of the Extreme Learning Machine.
